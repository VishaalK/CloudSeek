# How to develop on this locally
You need to have PHP installed, as well as Composer (https://getcomposer.org). Pull the repository and run "composer install" and "composer update". I don't know how to get your localhost working so we can figure that out later. I used this guide for my Mac (http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-9-mavericks/). We will at some point move it to Heroku so it lives on the internet and collaboration is easier.
